## Analysis of Gender Bias on Twitter: An NLP Project on Female Perceptions
In today's society, women frequently face a barrage of conflicting and often unfair expectations, especially in the public sphere. These conflicting standards are epitomized in narratives such as the video narrated by Cynthia Nixon titled, "Be a lady they said." It highlights the paradoxical demands like “Be experienced, be sexual, be innocent, be dirty.”

Modern discourse often undermines the achievements of women, casting shadows on their accomplishments, especially in realms such as relationships or physical appearance. A poignant example is the #immodestwomen movement from 2018, where a female Ph.D. holder was criticized for using her rightful "Dr" title, suggesting the deep-rooted gender discrimination prevalent in society.

For many, the term "female" has unfortunately been wielded as a restraint, establishing what women should or shouldn't do based on societal constructs. This project endeavors to cast a spotlight on such perceptions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze comments about women on Twitter. The primary objectives include:

Data Collection: Leveraging the snscrape library to capture tweets containing significant keywords associated with female bias.

**Data Preprocessing**: Engaging in thorough data refinement processes, such as deduplication, punctuation removal, and tokenization using TweetTokenizer, to prepare data for analysis.

**Topic Modeling**: Employing advanced NLP techniques, specifically LDA and LSA, to ascertain the primary topics surrounding female bias on Twitter.

**Results Synthesis**: Presenting the discerned topics and associated prevalent keywords, providing a foundation for more in-depth insights into the state of gender discourse on social media.

Through this project, I aim to offer a nuanced understanding of the sentiments and biases surrounding women, showcasing my adeptness in harnessing the power of NLP for sociological insights.
